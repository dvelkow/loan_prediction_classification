## Overview
In this project, I aim to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on a set of features provided in the dataset. This involves several steps including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of various features related to loan applicants. Here's a quick rundown of the files:

loan.csv: The main dataset containing applicant information and loan approval status.
Data_Dictionary.xlsx: An Excel file that provides detailed descriptions of the features in the dataset.

## Setup Instructions
To get started with the project, you'll need to set up your Python environment with the required libraries. Here's how you can do it:

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-classification.git
cd loan-classification
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```
## How to use
Place the dataset files (loan.csv and Data_Dictionary.xlsx) in the project directory. Then open and run the Jupyter notebook.

```bash
jupyter notebook Loan_Classification.ipynb
```
In the notebook, you'll find all the steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Approach
Here's a brief overview of my approach to solving the loan classification problem:

- Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values appropriately.
- Encoded categorical variables.
- Scaled numerical features to ensure uniformity.
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualized the distribution of various features.
- Identified correlations and relationships between features.
- Feature Engineering
- Created new features to improve model performance.
- Proceeded with the most relevant features.
- Model Building
- Experimented with several algorithms
- Optimize model performance.
- Model Evaluation
- Compared performance across different models to select the best one.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of ?% on the test dataset. For more detailed results and insights, please refer to the Jupyter notebook.
